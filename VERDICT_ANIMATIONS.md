    animation: goldenGlow 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}

.verdict-borderline {

```javascript
const flavorQuips = {
    faithful: [ /* 5 positive quips */ ],

    doomed: [ /* 5 condemnatory quips */ ]
};

function getRandomQuip(category) {
    const quips = flavorQuips[category];
    return quips[Math.floor(Math.random() * quips.length)];
}
```

### Verdict Structure

```html
<div class="verdict-container verdict-faithful">
    <div class="parchment-scroll">
