3. Try to match orthodox doctrine as defined by historical church councils
4. Receive your verdict based on how many heresies you've committed

## Customization

You can easily add more questions by editing `public/questions.json`. Each question needs:

- `orthodox`: Whether agreeing with it is orthodox (true) or heretical (false)
- `council`: The ID of the council that ruled on this doctrine

## Historical Note

This game uses a simplified, Western/Catholic perspective on "orthodoxy" for gameplay purposes. Real theological history is far more complex, with different Christian traditions having varying views on these doctrines.

May your orthodoxy shine bright... or may you discover just how heretical you truly are! ‚öîÔ∏èüìø
